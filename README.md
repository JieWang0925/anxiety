Predicting-generalized-anxiety-disorder-among-Chinese-depressed-adolescents:an explainable machine learning approach

The co-occurrence of depression and anxiety in adolescents is associated with a greater risk than the presence of depressive symptoms alone. Predicting anxiety disorders among depressed adolescents is critical for interventions and therapeutic tools.We recruited 2316 depressed adolescents through the Chinese Adolescent Depression Cohort (CADC) and collected 34 predictive factors for model construction. The Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) prediction model and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) algorithm were implemented for in-depth interpretation of the predictive importance of different factors. Through machine learning modeling, the results of SHAP analysis reveal the interactive effects of paired predictive factors on the risk of different levels of anxiety. This document provides the SHAP interaction results for all paired predictive factors.
